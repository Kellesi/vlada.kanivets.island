# vlada.kanivets.island
JavaRush final project for module 2

The multithreading island model consisting of an array of locations. The size of the island and the day duration are set from the console.

The locations are filled with plants and animals. Animals can:

•	eat plants and/or other animals (if there is suitable food in their location) with a certain probability,

•	move (to nearby locations),

•	reproduce (if there is a pair for them in the location),

•	 starve or be eaten.

After each day, statistics about island are displayed in the console.

The level of displayed statistic is set from the console:

•	Choose TOTAL to see total statistic of the island (total animal population, total plant population, amount of eaten plants, died animals, newborn animals)

•	Choose AREA to see population of each area.
